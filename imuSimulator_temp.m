% INPUTS
%
% S ---------- Structure with the following elements:
%
%        statek = State of the quad at tk, expressed as a structure with the
%                 following elements:
%                   
%                  rI = 3x1 position of CM in the I frame, in meters
%
%                  vI = 3x1 velocity of CM with respect to the I frame and
%                       expressed in the I frame, in meters per second.
%
%                  aI = 3x1 acceleration of CM with respect to the I frame and
%                       expressed in the I frame, in meters per second^2.
% 
%                 RBI = 3x3 direction cosine matrix indicating the
%                       attitude of B frame wrt I frame
%
%              omegaB = 3x1 angular rate vector expressed in the body frame,
%                       in radians per second.
%
%           omegaBdot = 3x1 time derivative of omegaB, in radians per
%                       second^2.
%
% P ---------- Structure with the following elements:
%
%  sensorParams = Structure containing all relevant parameters for the
%                 quad's sensors, as defined in sensorParamsScript.m 
%
%     constants = Structure containing constants used in simulation and
%                 control, as defined in constantsScript.m 
%
% OUTPUTS
%
