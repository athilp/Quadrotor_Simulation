% INPUTS
%
% R ---------- Structure with the following elements:
%
%       zIstark = 3x1 desired body z-axis direction at time tk, expressed as a
%                 unit vector in the I frame.
%
%       xIstark = 3x1 desired body x-axis direction, expressed as a
%                 unit vector in the I frame.
%
% S ---------- Structure with the following elements:
%
%        statek = State of the quad at tk, expressed as a structure with the
%                 following elements:
%                   
%                  rI = 3x1 position in the I frame, in meters
% 
%                 RBI = 3x3 direction cosine matrix indicating the
%                       attitude
%
%                  vI = 3x1 velocity with respect to the I frame and
%                       expressed in the I frame, in meters per second.
%                 
%              omegaB = 3x1 angular rate vector expressed in the body frame,
%                       in radians per second.
%
% P ---------- Structure with the following elements:
%
%    quadParams = Structure containing all relevant parameters for the
%                 quad, as defined in quadParamsScript.m 
%
%     constants = Structure containing constants used in simulation and
%                 control, as defined in constantsScript.m 
%
%
% OUTPUTS
